# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh




Here are five different features and functionalities that this website have:

1. **User Authentication:**
   - The website allows users to register and log in using their email and password. It also provides a "Sign Out" option for logged-in users, ensuring secure access to certain parts of the site.

2. **password Validation:**
    - These password validation checks help ensure that users create strong and secure passwords that are less susceptible to common security threats. By enforcing password requirements like length, capital letters, and special characters, you can enhance the overall security of user accounts on your website.

3. **Profile Information Display:**
   - When a user is logged in, the website displays the user's name and profile picture in the navigation bar. This feature personalizes the user experience and provides quick access to their account information.

4. **Google Sign-In Option:**
   - The website offers the option to log in using a Google account. Users can click on a Google Sign-In button, which presumably triggers the Google OAuth authentication flow for easy and secure login.

5. **Feedback with SweetAlert:**
   - The website provides user feedback using the `swal` library (SweetAlert). It displays success messages upon successful login and error messages when there are login issues, enhancing the user experience by providing clear and visually appealing feedback.

These features and functionalities contribute to a user-friendly and interactive website that offers user authentication, navigation, and feedback capabilities.
